# BP_MNIST

This is a matlab scipt applying error backpropagation algorithm to train on MNIST database of handwritten digits. You can find the database in [this page](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist).

The two database reading functions were based on UFLDL's page for [using the MNIST Dataset](ufdl.stanford.edu/wiki/index/index.php/Using_the_MNIST_Dataset).

As the result, the test error rate for this one-layer neural network algorithm is 7.81%.
