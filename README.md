# BP_MNIST

This is a matlab scipt applying error backpropagation algorithm to train on MNIST database of handwritten digits. You can find the database in [this page](https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist).

The two database reading functions were based on UFLDL's page for [using the MNIST Dataset](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Using_the_MNIST_Dataset).

As the result, the test error rate for this one-layer neural network classifier is 4.72% by 10 times of training.
